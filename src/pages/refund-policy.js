    <p>
      Hi, this is Jarod!  Satisfaction with your order is very important to me.
      I take pride in the quality of my products and want you to experience that
      quality as well.  Please understand that I source the best
      products/equipment/bees and depend on the Honey Bees that create our
      products.  As a result, crops can vary each year or season, giving
      different variations in look and taste in my products throughout the year.
      Due to the nature of the products all sales are final and no returns or
      refund are allowed, however, any products that are missing or damaged
      during shipping are eligible for a full refund or credit as long as
      notification is given within 3 days of completed shipment.  Notification
      must be sent to hooverjarod@gmail.com no later than 3 days upon receipt of
      your order.
    </p>
