        title="Powerful Nutrients"
        text="Honey has been used for centuries for healing and rejuvenation. Most of
        the honey sold in stores has been heated andÂ pasteurized. This
        processing destroys all of the enzymes and beneficial compounds that
        make raw honey so nutritious. Our honey is completely left
        in its natural state right from the hives and therefore contains pollen,
        enzymes, antioxidants and many other beneficial compounds that
        researchers are just beginning to learn the great benefits about."

        title="Incredible Taste"
        text="Regular honey often looks clear and
        syrupy. Our honey has not been treated with heat; it is often more
        buttery, solid and opaque than pasteurized honey. This difference results in a richer and more decadent taste. It makes everything you put it in taste better. Real products from nature always tastes the best."
